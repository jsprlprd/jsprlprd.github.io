  summary:
  - As one of the leading anti-virus company, serving 30% of the enterprise market
    worldwide, giving the best customer support is key to the their success.
  - In my almost 2 years stint, I was a key person tasked in modernizing its legacy
    Enterprise Support Portal into a more user-friendly and mobile-responsive web
    application. Our goal is to give our customers an intuitive way of accessing Trend
    Micro's support services by enabling them to quickly file for a support ticket
    through the portal. We've streamlined other business processes by integrating
    them into the portal and automated other routinic task. This enables faster case
    resolutions which freed up valuable man-hours that can be refocused to a more
    impactful task.
  - During it's development, I noticed a gap between the design team and the development
    team. To solve this, I've translated the company's design guidelines into a web-based
    living design system. This established a common language for both teams and enables
    the designers to design/prototype directly into the web. It also ensured that
    the design specifications will be strictly followed without the need to create
    a separate design documents, which ultimately cuts the designer-developer handoff
    time into half.
